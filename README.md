# Go Gas

Go Gas is a web application where users can post the current price of gas at a specific station and leave a review for that station. I used the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack to create this web application. I integrated with the google maps api to render a map around the user that leaves pins at the closest gas stations by the user. I used Material UI to create all of my custom components and also for creating both light/dark themes that can be switched with the click of a button
